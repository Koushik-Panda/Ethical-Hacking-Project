# Ethical-Hacking-Project
This project is designed to help understand ethical hacking to gain access to a victimâ€™s machine.

Scenario: The production environment was breached by an organization called CardPerso, and PII or PCI data is now available on the darknet. 
The CISO wants to know how personally identifiable information (PII) and PCI data kept on the network could be stolen or that server downtime could interfere with card creation. 
Under a legal contract, the organization hired a firm to perform ethical hacking.

Ethical Hacking: Cybercriminals (also known as malicious hackers) look for network weaknesses to attack in the more well-known unlawful counterpart of ethical hacking.
Reconnaissance & Footprinting : Reconnaissance, a more comprehensive approach, includes footprinting. The information gathering phase of ethical hacking is known as reconnaissance, 
during which you gather information about the intended system.
Vulnerabilities and Exploit: A security vulnerability is a defect in the software code or a configuration error in a system that allows attackers to 
gain direct access to a system or network without authorization. As soon as they are inside, the attacker can use their privileges and authorizations to
compromise systems and assets. The method through which hackers launch an attack using a vulnerability is known as an exploit.
